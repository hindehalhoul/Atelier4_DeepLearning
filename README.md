During this lab, I learned about several key concepts and techniques related to deep learning and generative models using the PyTorch library:

    Autoencoder (AE) and Variational Autoencoder (VAE):
        Built autoencoder and variational autoencoder architectures.
        Trained the models on the MNIST dataset.
        Explored hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.
        Evaluated the models using various metrics such as loss and KL divergence.
        Visualized the latent space of the models to understand the learned representations.

    Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs):
        Defined the architecture for both the generator and discriminator.
        Implemented a custom loss function for training the GAN.
        Initialized and trained the generator and discriminator.
        Configured data loading and defined optimizers for training.
